### Framer 5

A complete rewrite of the core, with everything on top.

#### Big things

- Completely move over to TypeScript for faster development, automated autocomplete and documentation.
- Virtual DOM based rendering while retaining fast performance, especially on mobile.
- A unified component system for easier extensibilty â€“ loosely based on React components.
- An overhaul of the animation system adding animation groups and properties.
- A better way to deal with groups of states for multiple layers at the same time.
- Use points everywhere, without adding to the complexity by default.
- Better testing setup with replayable events for interaction testing.
